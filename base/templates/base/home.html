					<h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>After 120+ Applications, I finally got my first internship, "Skill Squirrel", a start up that came in for me and provided me with an internship.</p>

					<p>I went from writing Hello World to developing new features using ReactJS framework, life changed for the better. I completed 11 tasks throughout the duration of 4 years.</p>

					<p>I can surely say that the fine line between me being a beginner dev and me being an intermediate developer, is Skill Squirrel.</p>

					<hr>
					<p>Practice! Practice! Practice!.</p>

					<p>I am not the best at memorising academic concepts, but I can understand a concept in a split second, but at the end of the day, experience is what matters, so pretty much, yeah practice is what I do, because at the end of the day, that is what makes my code best.</p>
